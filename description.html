      <p class="w3-large"> With guidance from the 2018 FSU iGEM team, we set out to find a problem, need, or curiosity in the world that could be addressed with synthetic biology. Since most members of our team are Florida natives, the effects of citrus greening have been evident for a while. Through our research, we found that citrus greening resulted in a $2.9 billion loss in revenue for orange growers in Florida from 2007 to 2014<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

      <p class="w3-large"> Florida is known for its abundance of beaches, voracious alligators, and sweet oranges. Since Citrus Greening affects our home state, we decided to focus on it. After visiting a citrus farm in Collier County and learning that the disease is prevalent in about 80% of their trees, we were more motivated to understand the problem and pursue a solution.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Our solution to the Citrus Greening epidemic is called FLOEMA.  FLOEMA is a wetware, hardware, and software solution that will one day heal our ailing citrus trees.  An overview of FLOEMA is depicted in the diagram below.  FLOEMA is composed of: A Therapy Management Subsystem that provides citrus growers assistance on when and how much antimicrobial therapy should be provided to the citrus trees.  FloRx, an injector-catheter device, that can be used to access a citrus tree's phloem and deliver the antimicrobial therapy.  Finally, Antimicrobial Cocktails composed of three antimicrobial peptides that will eliminate <I>Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus</I>, the bacteria that is causing greening, and guard against the emergence of resistant strains.</p>
